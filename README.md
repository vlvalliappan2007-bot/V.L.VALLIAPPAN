# GaneshMart

Multi-seller e-commerce marketplace web application built with Java Servlets,
JDBC, and Apache Tomcat, for Anna University R2025 Semester 3.

> Checkpoint window: Jul 27 - Oct 10, 2026 &middot; Builder: solo

## Problem statement

Sellers list products. Buyers browse, search, add to cart, and purchase. An
admin manages users, orders, and listings. Checkout uses a mock payment
confirmation step (no real payment gateway is integrated). An AI chatbot
answers FAQ-style questions about products, orders, shipping, and returns.

## Feature status

| ID | Requirement | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| F1 | Registration/login, BUYER/SELLER roles, seed ADMIN | Implemented |
| F2 | Seller create/edit/delete listings | Implemented |
| F3 | Buyer browse/search by category & keyword | Implemented |
| F4 | Cart: add/update/remove, running total | Implemented |
| F5 | Checkout via mock payment confirmation | Implemented |
| F6 | Buyer order history / seller incoming orders | Implemented |
| F7 | Admin: view users/orders, moderate listings | Implemented |
| F8 | Product reviews & star ratings on completed orders | Implemented |
| O1 | Wishlist / save-for-later | Not started |
| O2 | Order status workflow (Pending->Confirmed->Shipped->Delivered) | Implemented |
| O3 | Seller sales dashboard (counts/revenue) | Not started |
| O4 | AI chatbot (mandatory for Final Review) | Implemented (mock provider by default; swap in Gemini via config flag) |

See `CHANGELOG.md` for release history and the timeline in the original spec
(Section 6) for the week-by-week plan this status table should track against.

## Architecture

Layered MVC over Servlets (Front Controller pattern):

```
Browser (JSP shell + vanilla JS/fetch)
  -> Filter layer: EncodingFilter, RequestIdFilter, AuthFilter
  -> Servlets (controller/*) - thin, no SQL, no business logic
  -> Service layer (service/*) - business rules, validation, no JDBC
  -> DAO layer (dao/impl/*) - all SQL, PreparedStatement only
  -> HikariCP connection pool (listener/AppContextListener)
  -> H2 Database (server mode)
```

See `docs/D1-er-diagram.puml`, `docs/D2-use-case-diagram.puml`, and
`docs/D3-sequence-diagram.puml` for the three required design diagrams
(render with the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) VS Code extension, the
online editor, or `plantuml docs/*.puml`).

Quick version:

```bash
cp src/main/resources/config.properties.example src/main/resources/config.properties
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.krishva.krishvamart.util.DbSeeder"
mvn clean package
cp target/krishvamart.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/
```

### Demo accounts (created by `DbSeeder`)

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | admin@krishvamart.com | Admin@12345 |
| Seller | priya.seller@krishvamart.com | Seller@123 |
| Seller | arjun.seller@krishvamart.com | Seller@123 |
| Buyer | divya.buyer@krishvamart.com | Buyer@1234 |
| Buyer | karthik.buyer@krishvamart.com | Buyer@1234 |

Change or remove these before any real/public deployment.

## Deployed link

_Not yet deployed - add the live Tomcat URL here once Section 10 deployment
is complete (due with the Full Build + Deploy checkpoint, Sep 21)._

## AI chatbot configuration

`ai.chatbot.provider` in `config.properties` selects the implementation
(Strategy pattern, Section 12):

- `mock` (default) - canned FAQ answers, no network call, no API key needed.
- `gemini` - calls the Gemini API server-side using `ai.chatbot.apiKey`
  (never exposed to the browser). See `com.krishva.krishvamart.chat.GeminiChatProvider`.

Guardrails (Section 17): 10 messages/minute per session, 500-character input
cap, 10s outbound timeout, fixed server-side prompt template restricting the
bot to product/order/shipping/returns questions, and in-memory per-session
caching of repeated questions.

## API contract

All JSON endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1/...` and return the fixed
envelope:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { }, "error": null }
{ "success": false, "data": null, "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "..." } }
```

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | /api/v1/auth/register | Public | BUYER/SELLER only (admin is seed-only) |
| POST | /api/v1/auth/login | Public | regenerates session id |
| POST | /api/v1/auth/logout | Session | |
| GET  | /api/v1/auth/me | Session | |
| GET  | /api/v1/products | Public | `?q=&category=` |
| GET  | /api/v1/products/{id} | Public | |
| POST/PUT/DELETE | /api/v1/products(/{id}) | Seller | owner-only |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | /api/v1/cart... | Buyer session | |
| POST | /api/v1/orders/checkout | Buyer | mock payment |
| GET  | /api/v1/orders(/{id}) | Session | scoped by role |
| PATCH| /api/v1/orders/{id}/status | Seller/Admin | O2 workflow |
| GET/POST | /api/v1/reviews... | Public GET / Buyer POST | F8 |
| GET  | /api/v1/admin/users, /api/v1/admin/orders | Admin | F7 |
| DELETE | /api/v1/admin/products/{id} | Admin | moderate/deactivate |
| POST | /api/v1/chat | Public | O4 |
| GET  | /api/v1/health | Public | `{status, db}` |

## Screenshots

_Add screenshots here once the app is running against the deployed URL
(Full Build + Deploy checkpoint requirement)._

## Known limitations

- O1 (wishlist) and O3 (seller sales dashboard) are not yet implemented -
  optional features, sequenced after F1-F8 per Section 1.
- `GeminiChatProvider` is wired but untested against a live API key in this
  environment; `mock` is the safe default until a key is configured.
- Diagrams are checked in as PlantUML source (`docs/*.puml`); render them to
  images before the design-diagram submission deadlines (Section 5).
